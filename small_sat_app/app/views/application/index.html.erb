  <h1>Technology Roadmap for Small Satellite Communications</h1>

  <p> Small satellite systems enable whole new class of missions for navigation,
    communications,  remotesensing  and  scientific  research  for  both
    civilian  and  military  purposes.   As  individual  spacecraft  are
    limited by the size,  mass and power constraints, mass-produced
    small satellites in large constellations or clusters could be useful in
    many science missions such as gravity mapping, tracking of forest fires,
    finding water resources, etc by providing improved  spatial  and  temporal
    resolution of the target. Future space missions  are  envisioned to become
    more complex and operate farther from Earth which will need to support
    autonomous operations with minimal human intervention, There will be a need to
    configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage intermediate nodes,
    and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives. Hence,
    inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in formation.
    We present the various researches being conducted in the small satellite
    community for implementing inter-satellite communications based on the Open
    System Interconnection (OSI) model, in particular the various design
    parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI model,
    i.e., physical, data link and network layer. </p>

<h1>Inter-satellite Communications for Small Satellite Systems</h1>

<p> Small satellite systems enable whole new class of missions for navigation,

  civilian  and  military  purposes.   As  individual  spacecraft  are
  limited by the size,  mass and power constraints, mass-produced
  small satellites in large constellations or clusters could be useful in
  many science missions such as gravity mapping, tracking of forest fires,
  finding water resources, etc.  The proliferation of small satellites will
  enable a better understanding ofthe near-Earth environment and provide
  an efficient and economical means to access the space throughthe  use  of
  multi-satellite  solution.   Constellation  of  satellites  provide
  improved  spatial  and  temporal resolution of the target. Small satellite
  constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing a single
  asset with several very capable spacecraft which opens the door to new
  applications. Future space missions  are  envisioned to become
  more complex and operate farther from Earth which will need to support
  autonomous operations with minimal human intervention. With increasing
  levels of autonomy, there will be a need for remote communication networks
  to enable communication between spacecraft. These space based networks
  will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage intermediate nodes,
  and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives. Hence,
  inter-satellite communicationis a key aspect when satellites fly in formation.
